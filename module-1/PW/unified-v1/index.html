                        Working as a support for over 10 years, we at CTS have been able to revive many hopeless homes and environments and help them move to the next stage in their story. More than 3.200 houses were rebuilt in Cuba and Haiti, arund 500 educacional institutions were opended in the Brasilian northeast and an average of 200 scientific and technological laboratories and forms of shelter for needy children, who managed to find a new purpose in life.

                        With our system of integrating ONGS from different countries, we can help in different outdated parts of your region or that of an acquaintance! With the power of technology, the motto that two heads are better than one has become even stronger. Maybe you want to help the homeless, run a charity campaign or help your distant relative cross the border. In the face of all these difficulties, it is not always helping everyone or having enough resources together to supply children in a state of experiences and breaking barriers as a way to help everyone without excepton.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hey person! Have you already seen the city of Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, in short, one of the visas, our teams directly in the routine of elderly people, children, in schools, cancer treatment centers to bring hope and give a hand to the next?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the impact of the pandemic, many doors have closed, however, this does not stop us from asking for help and uniting heads and hearts. Since 2020, we have brought, through our partners, ONGs from our partners, who were able to help and establish a link. On our success wall, you can check our contributions to society and you can also be part of the hands-on team!

- para que serve a propriedade 'float' ?
- para sites responsivos, é mais utilizado como definição de tamanho em porcentagem(%) do que em pixels, isso por que em pixels é definido um tamanho fixo!
