# Etec - Desenvolvimento de Sistemas 

This repository is a reflect of my journey during the technologist course `Desenvolvimento de Sistemas` and it's divided into three modules - since my course is three semesters - in which the projects are grouped by grades.

The common grades are:

- BD (banco de dados - database)
- PA (programacao e algoritmos - programming and algorithms)
- PW (programacao web - web programming)
- DS (desenvolvimento de sistemas - system development)
- SE (sistemas embarcados - embedded systems)
- PAM (programacao de aplicativos mobile - mobile app programming)

There are other grades like IP (*internet e protocolos / internet  protocols*), AS (*analise de sistemas / system analysis*) and DD (*design digital / digital design*), but I won't include them because they don't suit exactly on the purpose of this repository - as they aren't really related to coding.

## Note

It's worth to mention that most of the files included in this repository are in brazillian portuguese language.
